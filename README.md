# counting-api
## what for
This is an AWS serverless API gateway implementation based on the "Serverless Applications with Node.js" book by Slobodan Stojanovic and Aleksandar Simovic. I'm trying to implement a few different things:

*a resume view counter

*some counts of interesting statistics from popular web sites

We'll see how it turns out.
